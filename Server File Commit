Initial commit: Add server monitoring functionalities:
- Implement base server setup to listen on port 5000.
- Add functionality to retrieve core temperature using vcgencmd.
- Establish JSON data structure for client communication.

Enhance server with voltage and memory monitoring:
- Include vcgencmd calls to monitor core voltage.
- Add function to split memory between CPU and GPU.
- Update JSON structure to include new monitoring data.

Integrate clock frequency and SDRAM voltage retrieval:
- Add function to get clock frequencies of various components.
- Implement SDRAM voltage measurement for controller, I/O, and PHY.
- Ensure data is encapsulated within the JSON response.

Implement throttling and codec status checks:
- Create function to check system throttling state.
- Add retrieval of codec status for multiple codecs.
- Update server data response to include new checks.

Add disk usage information to server data output:
- Implement function to get disk usage via df command.
- Incorporate disk usage into server's JSON response.
- Ensure all server data is formatted for readability.

Refactor vcgencmd calls to use os module:
- Replace vcgencmd module usage with os.popen for system command execution.
- Ensure consistent data retrieval after refactor.
- Maintain JSON data structure for client communication.
